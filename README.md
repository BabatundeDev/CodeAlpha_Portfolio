# 🧑‍💻 CodeAlpha Portfolio – Task 3

This is my personal portfolio website, built as part of **Task 3** for the **Frontend Development Internship at CodeAlpha**. It showcases who I am, what I’ve built, and what I can do as a frontend developer.

It is responsive, interactive, animated, and crafted to reflect modern frontend standards and clean design principles.
